Description: This app will introduce logistic regression model to you and it 
             allow you to explore Single Logistic Regression with simulated data and the 
             Empirical Logit Plot with real datasets.
LearningObjectives: c(
    "The student will learn to understand the parameters in the Logistic Regression model",
    "The student will learn to draw the plot of Logistic Regression model with specific dataset."
