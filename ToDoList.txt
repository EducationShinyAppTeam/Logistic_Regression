# Things Needed for This Version
1. Fix Console Messages: 
    `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
    
    New Messages Found:
    Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).
    Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
    
2. Figure out where Extra code is supposed to be used.
    (Multiple Linear Regression? More tabs in the explore page?)

# Ideas for Future Development

1.Improve prereq's(Maybe add collapsable tabs?)
2.Replace plot pictures for the quiz with rendered plots?
